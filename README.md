# Gomoku

GENERAL

  Gomoku is a 2 player board game, also known as "5 in a row" where players take turns
  in placing their stones on the board, in an attempt to obtain a chain of 5 consecutive stones.
  To win at Gomoku you must have exactly 5 stones in a row, otherwise the chain is ignored. If
  the board fills before a player is able to win, the game is deemed a draw.

CONFIGURATION
  
  The Gomoku game can be configured using typescript to change the board size through the game constructor.
